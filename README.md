Surface Optimisation for Deposition on Materials


======

The start of the SODoM code. So far SodomStack.py exists.
It takes two lattices (substrate and epilayer) and then 
manipulates the epilayer (translation/rotation) followed 
by deposition on the substrate.


======

TODO:

Make deposition symmetric (i.e. on both substrate surfaces).

Decide on move classes.

Develop the Monte Carlo driver.

Add piece-by-piece deposition (simulated ALD).
